# LangChain Tutorial Projects
This repository contains a collection of coding projects that I followed while training on the LangChain Python library. LangChain is a powerful framework built around LLMs (Language Model Models) that enables us to build advanced natural language processing applications such as chatbots, question-answering systems, and summarization tools.

The LangChain library provides a set of components that can be chained together to create more complex applications. The main components of LangChain include tokenization, language modeling, text generation, and text classification.

## Project Structure
Each project in this repository is stored in a separate directory, and the directory name describes the purpose of the project. Within each project directory, there is a README file that provides a brief overview of the project and the steps to reproduce the results.

Additionally, each project directory contains a src directory that contains the source code for the project, as well as any necessary data files. The src directory is structured as follows:

``` bash
src/
├── **project_files      # The files for the project
└── README.md            # details and thanks to the tutorial followed
```
Tutorial Details
For each project, I have included a tutorial.md file that provides details about the tutorial video that I followed to complete the project, as well as any thanks or acknowledgments that I would like to give. The tutorial.md file is structured as follows:

# Tutorial Details
```markdown
- **Tutorial Title:** [Title of Tutorial]
- **Tutorial Author:** [Author or Creator of Tutorial]
- **Tutorial Link:** [Link to Tutorial Video or Website]()
- **Tutorial GitHub Link:** [Link to GitHub Tutorial]()
- **Thanks/Acknowledgments:** [Optional: Any thanks or acknowledgments you would like to give]
```

## Requirements
