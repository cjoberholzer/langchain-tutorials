# LangChain Tutorial Projects
This repository contains a collection of coding projects that I followed while training on the LangChain Python library. LangChain is a powerful framework built around LLMs (Language Model Models) that enables us to build advanced natural language processing applications such as chatbots, question-answering systems, and summarization tools.

The LangChain library provides a set of components that can be chained together to create more complex applications. The main components of LangChain include tokenization, language modeling, text generation, and text classification.

## Project Structure
Each project in this repository is stored in a separate directory, and the directory name describes the purpose of the project. Within each project directory, there is a README file that provides a brief overview of the project and the steps to reproduce the results.

Additionally, each project directory contains a src directory that contains the source code for the project, as well as any necessary data files. The src directory is structured as follows:

``` bash
src/
├── data/                # data files used in the project
├── models/              # trained models (if applicable)
├── utils/               # utility functions used in the project
├── main.py              # main script for running the project
├── requirements.txt     # list of required Python packages
└── tutorial.md          # details and thanks to the tutorial followed
```
Tutorial Details
For each project, I have included a tutorial.md file that provides details about the tutorial video that I followed to complete the project, as well as any thanks or acknowledgments that I would like to give. The tutorial.md file is structured as follows:

# Tutorial Details
```markdown
- **Tutorial Title:** [Title of Tutorial]
- **Tutorial Author:** [Author or Creator of Tutorial]
- **Tutorial Link:** [Link to Tutorial Video or Website]
- **Thanks/Acknowledgments:** [Optional: Any thanks or acknowledgments you would like to give]
```

## Requirements
To run the projects in this repository, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed, as well as the LangChain library and any other required packages. The required packages for each project are listed in the requirements.txt file in the project's src directory.

To install the required packages for a project, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run a project, navigate to the project directory and run the main.py script using Python:

```bash
cd project_directory
python src/main.py
```

This will execute the project and produce the desired output. For more information on the project and its expected output, see the project's README.md file.
